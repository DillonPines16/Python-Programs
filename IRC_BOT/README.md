Thanks for checking out my IRC-Bot. This irc bot is very simple, all that it does is connect to your desired channel and creates a new text file logging all the data that the irc channel recieves while its idle in the chat.

To use this bot you will have to open bot.py and change the commented parameters to the desired channel, server and nickname.
Save it and run the bot.py file with a python 2.7 compiler.

Thank you for checking out my program. If you like this and would like to see some of my other projects you can check them out here on github or check out my website <a href="www.dillonpines.com">here.</a></em></span>
